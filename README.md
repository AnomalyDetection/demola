# Demola
Demola is a developing innovation hub where multi-discipline university students gather together to solve the real problems from the real industries. 

# Anomaly Detection
Anomaly Detection is the name of the project proposed by Intel Inc. The background is Intel collected huge amount of digital signature requests from Intel's customers. Only a small part of the requests are anomalies. Manual review and approval for signing requests cannot be applied as at the same time quick reactions to problems are required in customer oriented environment. So the expection would be detecting anomalies by programmes automatically.

# Relation Probability Algorithm
RP(Relation Probability) is a Machine Learning thinking Algorithm. It learns the probability distribution of the relations among the features all the train data(the valid data in general). Then the program starts to detect the new data to find out the anomalies who have the extremly low probabilies.

# File structure
RP - src of Relation Probability Algorithm
gmm - Gaussian Mixture Models
data - train data and test data
doc - all the reference documents including the technology document of the project
